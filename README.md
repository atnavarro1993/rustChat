# the most **simple** manual to use this project

1. if you clone the project just run cargo run --release --bin client <host>:<port> and cargo run --release --bin server <host>:<port> each on their own terminal (one for the server, multiple for the client)
 
2. on the client side you have 3 options for now:
  - join chat -> where chat is the chat you want join/create
  - post chat message -> where it checks if chat exists and if exists once you joined prints a message (replace "message" with anything you want)
  - leave -> it closes the terminal where you ran the client
